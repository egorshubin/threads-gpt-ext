Have you ever been deep in a ChatGPT conversation, wishing you could explore a different line of thought without losing your current context? Standard chats are linear, making it difficult to manage multiple ideas or variations.
**Setty Chat** solves this by adding a powerful branching capability directly to the ChatGPT interface. Create a new, independent "thread" from any point in your conversation, preserving the history and organizing your chats into an intuitive tree structure.
## Key Features
- **Branch Your Conversations**: Create a new, separate chat (a "thread") from any message in your existing ChatGPT conversation.
- **Visual Chat Tree**: View all your conversations and their branches in an easy-to-navigate tree structure right in the extension's popup.
- **Preserves Full Context**: Each new thread automatically includes the full history from the parent chat up to the branching point.
- **Seamless Integration**: A simple "Save as Thread" button is added directly into the ChatGPT UI, making it feel like a native feature.
- **Private & Secure**: All your chat data and tree structures are stored locally in your browser's storage. Nothing is sent to external servers.

## How It Works
1. While on , you will see a new **"Save as Thread"** button appear next to each of the assistant's messages. `chatgpt.com`
2. Click this button to branch your conversation from that specific point.
3. A new chat will open automatically, with the history up to your chosen message pre-loaded.
4. The new chat is now linked to the original one as a child "thread".
5. Click the Setty Chat icon in your browser's toolbar to open the popup and see your complete conversation tree.
